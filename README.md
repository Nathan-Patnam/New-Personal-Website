# Welcome to Nathan Patnam's Personal Website Repo

I built this website using some of the skills I picked up while working at GiftPocket.

In terms of the technologies I used, I chose to use React. Some of the cool CI/CD technologies I got to play around with were.\

1. GitHub Actions to run my CI/CD pipelines.
2. Jest/Enzyme for unit and component testing.
3. CodeCov for generating and tracking code coverage through the project's lifecycle
4. ESLint
